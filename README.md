# Snake4D


## Introduction

The culminating performance task for my final year in high school was to create a game. This involved the use of object-oriented programming concepts and external libraries. The project we ended up making is a four-dimensional version of Snake.


## The Result

The game ended up being pretty crazy, which is to be expected. You control the y-axis with the up and down arrows, the x-axis with the left and right arrows, the w-axis with the a and d keys, and finally the z-axis with the w and s keys.

If you'd like to run it yourself, just import it as a project into eclipse, right click the project and run it as a Java application.
